# implimentation nodes
we cant just add a function to export a character to hammergen as the import to foundry is onerous with its requirements: every talent and skill (all of which are `items` in foundry) need to define their name, stats, etc which is a big pain to keep. its better just to have a mapping table and sync locally.



# other things to fix
talent Unshakeable is spelt Unshakable in rulebook

career levels cannot be searched by their level name, only the base career name. this makes mapping very difficult

Animal Training (Pegasus) missing 

Lore (Magick) spelt without a k
